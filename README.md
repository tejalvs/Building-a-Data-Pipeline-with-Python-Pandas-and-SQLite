# Data Pipelines for ETL with Google Play Store Apps

## Situation

**Problem:** Extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from flat files into a database for analysis and further use.
**Context:** Working with the "Google Play Store Apps" dataset to extract relevant information for analysis.

## Task

- Built Python functions to extract, transform, and load data from CSV files into a SQLite database.
- Extracted data from CSV files and Transformed the data to filter out apps and reviews based on specified criteria. Loaded the transformed data into a SQLite database.

## Action

**Techniques and Tools:**

- Utilized **Python**, **pandas**, and **sqlite3** for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- Applied data manipulation techniques such as filtering, joining, and aggregating to transform the data.
- Created functions to automate the ETL process, promoting reusability and efficiency.

**Process:**

- Extracted data using pandas' **`read_csv`** function and printed basic information about the data.
- Transformed the data by dropping duplicates, filtering based on category, rating, and review count, and sorting the results.
- Loaded the transformed data into a SQLite database using pandas' **`to_sql`** function and verified the integrity of the loaded data.

## Result

**Outcome:**

- Successfully extracted, transformed, and loaded data from CSV files into a SQLite database.
- Created a dataset of top-rated food and drink apps with a minimum rating of 4 stars and at least 1000 reviews.
- Loaded dataset into the "market_research" SQLite database, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

**Achievements:**

- Created a reusable data pipeline for ETL tasks, enhancing data processing efficiency.
- Produced a curated dataset suitable for further analysis and insights generation.
- Ensured data quality and reliability for downstream analytics and decision-making.

**Impact:**

- Enabled stakeholders to access curated data for market research and analysis.
- Facilitated informed decision-making and strategic planning based on reliable data insights.

## Reflection

**Lessons Learned:**

- Importance of automating repetitive tasks to improve productivity and maintain data consistency.
- Enhanced understanding of data manipulation techniques and SQL database operations.

**Improvements:**

- Incorporate error handling mechanisms to address potential data inconsistencies or processing failures.
- Enhance documentation and code readability for better maintainability and collaboration.

**Advice:**

- Prioritize data quality and consistency throughout the ETL process to ensure reliable insights.
- Continuously evaluate and refine the data pipeline to adapt to evolving requirements and improve efficiency.
- Document and communicate the ETL process to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration within the team.
